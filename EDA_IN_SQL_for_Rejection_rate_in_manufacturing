-----Let's create a SQL Script for Rejection rate in Manufacturing environment

--Let's create a table as a workbook
CREATE TABLE Portfolio_Projects.dbo.workbook$ (
Product_id NVARCHAR(50),
TicketNumber FLOAT,
Slab/Extruder NVARCHAR(50),
Slitter_number FLOAT,
Team NVARCHAR(50),
Month FLOAT,
Day FLOAT,
Weekday NVARCHAR(50),
Year FLOAT,
Datetime DATETIME,
Defect NVARCHAR(50),
Observation FLOAT(50),
Time DATETIME
)

--Let's insert data into workbook from the indiviaul datasets:

INSERT INTO Portfolio_Projects.dbo.workbook$ (Product_id,
TicketNumber, [Slab/Extruder], Slitter_number, Team, Month, Day,
Weekday, Year, Datetime, Defect, Observation, Time)
(
SELECT Product_id, TicketNumber, [Slab/Extruder], Slitter_number, Team, Month, Day, 
Weekday, Year, Datetime, Defect, Observation, Time

FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.A
)
UNION ALL
(
SELECT Product_id, TicketNumber, [Slab/Extruder], Slitter_number, Team, Month, Day, 
Weekday, Year, Datetime, Defect, Observation, Time

FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.B
)
UNION ALL
(
SELECT Product_id, TicketNumber, [Slab/Extruder], Slitter_number, Team, Month, Day, 
Weekday, Year, Datetime, Defect, Observation, Time

FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.C
)
UNION ALL
(
SELECT Product_id, TicketNumber, [Slab/Extruder], Slitter_number, Team, Month, Day, 
Weekday, Year, Datetime, Defect, Observation, Time

FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.D
)
UNION ALL

(
SELECT Product_id, TicketNumber, [Slab/Extruder], Slitter_number, Team, Month, Day, 
Weekday, Year, Datetime, Defect, Observation, Time

FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.E
)
UNION ALL

(
SELECT Product_id, TicketNumber, [Slab/Extruder], Slitter_number, Team, Month, Day, 
Weekday, Year, Datetime, Defect, Observation, Time

FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.F

--General Overview---
SELECT *
FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.workbook$

---Let's use self join function to replace NULL values in "Slab/Extruder" column with an actual value which can be referenced ousing other columns

SELECT W1.Product_id, W1.Observation, W2.Product_id, W2.Observation, W2.[Slab/Extruder]
FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.workbook$ AS W1
JOIN Portfolio_Projects.dbo.workbook$ AS W2
ON W1.Product_id = W2.Product_id
AND W1.[Observation] = W2.[Observation]
WHERE [Slab/Extruder] IS NULL

--We do this because although the  "Product_id" is same for the records but the "Observation" for each record is different.

---Let's Update the NULL values

UPDATE W1
SET Slab/Extruder = 
ISNULL(W1.Slab/Extruder, W2.Slab/Extruder)

FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.workbook$ AS W1
JOIN Portfolio_Projects.dbo.workbook$ AS W2
ON W1.Product_id = W2.Product_id
AND W1.[Observation] = W2.[Observation]
WHERE [Slab/Extruder] IS NULL

--Let's Double-check for the NULL values
SELECT Slab/Extruder
FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.workbook$
WHERE Slab/Extruder IS NULL         ----------------0 Records


---Let's repeat the same process for "Team" Column:

UPDATE W1
SET Team = 
ISNULL(W1.Team, W2.Team)

FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.workbook$ AS W1
JOIN Portfolio_Projects.dbo.workbook$ AS W2
ON W1.Product_id = W2.Product_id
AND W1.[Observation] = W2.[Observation]
WHERE [Team] IS NULL

--Let's Double-check for the NULL values
SELECT Slab/Extruder
FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.workbook$
WHERE Team IS NULL         ----------------0 Records

---Now. that we have all the required information,
--Let's begin the Analysis.





---Let's count for the number of NC Sheets by Product ID

SELECT Product_id, COUNT(TicketNumber) AS Count_on_NC_Sheets
FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.workbook$
GROUP BY Product_id
ORDER BY Count_on_NC_Sheets DESC

---Let's count for the number of NC Sheet by Team

SELECT Team, COUNT(TicketNumber) AS Count_on_NC_Sheets
FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.workbook$
GROUP BY Team
ORDER BY Count_on_NC_Sheets DESC

----Let's count for the number of NC Sheets by the Slab/Extruder the Slab was extruded from:

SELECT [Slab/Extruder], COUNT(TicketNumber) AS Count_on_NC_Sheets
FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.workbook$
GROUP BY [Slab/Extruder]
ORDER BY Count_on_NC_Sheets DESC

---NC Sheets VS Day_of_week

SELECT Weekday, COUNT(TicketNumber) AS Count_on_NC_Sheets
FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.workbook$
GROUP BY Weekday
ORDER BY Count_on_NC_Sheets DESC

---NC Sheets by Month

SELECT Month, COUNT(TicketNumber) AS Count_on_NC_Sheets
FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.workbook$
GROUP BY Month
ORDER BY Count_on_NC_Sheets DESC

--NC By day of the week

SELECT Day, COUNT(TicketNumber) AS Count_on_NC_Sheets
FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.workbook$
GROUP BY Day
ORDER BY Count_on_NC_Sheets DESC  

---NC VS Hourly(24 hrs) basis

SELECT Time, COUNT(TicketNumber) AS Count_on_NC_Sheets
FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.workbook$
GROUP BY Time
ORDER BY Time 

---NC VS Defect Type

SELECT Defect, COUNT(TicketNumber) AS Count_on_NC_Sheets
FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.workbook$
GROUP BY Defect
ORDER BY Count_on_NC_Sheets DESC

----Breakdown on 1st top Defect---

SELECT Defect, COUNT(TicketNumber) AS Count_on_NC_Sheets, Observation
FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.workbook$
WHERE Defect LIKE '%Under Tol%'
GROUP BY Defect, Observation
ORDER BY Observation

---Breakdown on 2nd top defect----

SELECT Defect, COUNT(TicketNumber) AS Count_on_NC_Sheets, Observation
FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.workbook$
WHERE Defect LIKE '%Slitter Marks%'
GROUP BY Defect, Observation
ORDER BY Observation

--Breakdown on 1st top defect by slab/Extruder--

SELECT [Slab/Extruder], COUNT(TicketNumber) AS Count_on_NC_Sheets, Observation
FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.workbook$
WHERE [Slab/Extruder] LIKE '%B%'
GROUP BY [Slab/Extruder], Observation
ORDER BY Observation

--
--Breakdown on 2ND top defect by slab/Extruder--
SELECT [Slab/Extruder], COUNT(TicketNumber) AS Count_on_NC_Sheets, Observation
FROM Portfolio_Projects.dbo.workbook$
WHERE [Slab/Extruder] LIKE '%F%'
GROUP BY [Slab/Extruder], Observation
